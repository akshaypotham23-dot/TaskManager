Task Management Web Application
Overview-
This project is a simple and user-friendly Task Management web application. It helps users
organize their daily tasks by allowing them to add, view, update, and delete tasks easily through a
web interface.
Frontend Technology-
The frontend is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML provides the structure of the
application, CSS ensures a clean and responsive design, and JavaScript handles user interactions
and dynamic content updates without reloading the page.
Backend Technology-
The backend is built using Python Flask, a lightweight web framework. Flask is used to create
RESTful APIs that handle requests from the frontend and process task-related operations
efficiently.
Database-
The application uses SQLite as the database for persistent storage. SQLite is a lightweight,
file-based database that stores task information such as title, description, and status in a structured
format.
Working Flow-
When a user performs an action such as adding or deleting a task, the frontend sends a request to
the Flask backend using the Fetch API. The backend processes the request, updates the database,
and sends a response back to the frontend, which updates the user interface accordingly.
Key Highlights-
• Clean and responsive user interface
• REST API-based architecture
• Persistent data storage using SQLite
• Clear separation of frontend and backend logic
• Beginner-friendly and easy to understand implementation
Conclusion-
This project demonstrates the basic concepts of full-stack web development, including frontend
design, backend API development, database integration, and client–server communication
